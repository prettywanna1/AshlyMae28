				<p>Once a place of refuge for those people running from the tyranny of colonizers, today, the town is home to the Miraculous Shrine of Our Lady of Namacpacan. Locally known as Our Lady Apo Baket of Namacpacan, it was the title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary by the natives of La Union because she appeared to the native people of the Cordilleras as an old woman which offered them food and invited them to be baptized. Apo Baket is how the people call the elderly woman as a sign of respect.

				<p>The name BALAOAN was appended to the pueblo in very interesting yet funny stories about guns and bullets that would later create dramatic twists in the shaping of the town’s history and the noble character its residents inherited. BALAOAN in Ilocano tongue literally means, “NO BULLETS” or “BULLETS NO MORE”. Its name was interchangeably spelled “Balauan” or “Balaoang” in the old historical records.
